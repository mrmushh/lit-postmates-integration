Postmates Integration Development Log

figured out how to make api calls and set up a webhook endpoint
everything curl (website) is a great resource

Can make api calls with CURL
curl -v --user <API_KEY> https://api.example.com | jq '.'
the user part is basic http authorization
the v is for verbose (useful when testing)
the pipe at the end is to format json so its readable in standard output
jq i had to install (extra dependency)
alternativly you can pipe like this: | json_pp

Can make post request with CURL
curl --user $API_KEY: -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @$FILE  https://api.postmates.com/v1/customers/$CUSTOMER_ID/deliveries
-H is to specify that you are sending json instead of url encoded data
-d specifies what data you want to post (curl already knows you're using POST when using this option)
so there's no need to specify it with -X POST 

learned how to pretty format json in vim in case the json is all on one line
this is the command 
:!% python -m json.tool 

learned ngrok is super useful for testing, I set up a simple web server with a public url in minutes
you have to first make a python server that accepts post and get
downloaded one from the internet (in server.py file)
~ sudo ./server.py 80
make an ngrok account and install ngrok
make sure that your account authtoken is in config file with:
~ ./ngrok autoken @YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN (which you get from your profile)
fire it up
~ ./ngrok http 80
can access your local webserver over the internet!  

functionality I am working on first is just printing postmates order to console
things to remember to do in app:
verify that post is from postmates with sha 256 signature
look up the items in google sheets to see what printer to go to
only parse webhooks that have status = pickup and kind is event.delivery.status and get the manifest items from there

make express skeleton
make a git repository
found out you can make global git repositories for user based ignore files
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
gonna use this to ignore vim temporary files
